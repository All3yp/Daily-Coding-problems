## Problem 1 [Easy]

This problem was recently asked by Google.
Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers 
rom the list add up to k.
For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

## Problem 2 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Uber.

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element 
at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the 
original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output 
would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], 
the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

Follow-up: what if you can't use division?
